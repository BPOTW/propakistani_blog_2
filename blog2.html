    <p>The University of the Punjab has announced that the first week of September will be observed as a “Zero Week” due to ongoing severe weather conditions and widespread flooding across the country.
</p>
    <p>According to a notification issued by the university registrar, all academic activities from September 1 to 7 will remain suspended. The decision has been taken to ensure the safety and well-being of students, faculty, and staff.</p>
    <p>During this period, departments will focus on admission formalities, orientation sessions, and hostel allotments. Faculty and administrative staff will also carry out meet-and-greet activities to facilitate the return of students to campus.</p>
    <p>The notification stated that regular classes and examinations will officially begin on September 8, 2025. However, the previously issued academic calendar remains unaffected. If necessary, extra classes may be conducted online or scheduled on Saturdays to cover any shortfall.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the institution was directed to implement workplace reforms, including the formation of an inquiry committee and the public display of a code of conduct in English and Urdu.</p>
    <p>FOSPAH stressed that harassment extends beyond inappropriate advances, covering any act that undermines dignity, privacy, or instills fear among employees.</p>
    <p>“This ruling reinforces that surveillance cannot be weaponized to target or control staff. Respect for privacy and dignity is a core workplace right,” the ombudsperson’s office stated.</p>
